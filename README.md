# Emotion-Classification-Speech-Processing
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to classify emotions from speech audio using the RAVDESS dataset. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction (MFCC, Chroma, Mel Spectrogram), model training (LightGBM, XGBoost, SVM, etc.), evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit web app.
